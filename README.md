PLP App submission

Need a SQL db running on localhost  
DBname is "inventoryapp"  
Table name is "shopinv"  

Table layout is 4 columns named "ID", "Description", "CP", "SP"  
ID is the identification of the item  
Description is the item description  
CP is the cost price  
SP is the selling price
  
 
Username: SUT
Password: abcdefg123
  
Added sample invStock.data file, if it exists it is used, else it pulls from db and also keeps a local copy incase there is no internet. When the program is closed it saves it locally and tried to update the server.
